Working With Simple Components
----------------------------------

Working With Simple Components, you’ll focus on two exercises that will teach you how to manage state across components and how to fetch and render data using React. You’ll notice there are fewer knowledge checks in this module and that the NextTech activities and assignments may take you longer than in previous modules. This module is designed to encourage you to engage deeply with the coding exercises and to create personal coding projects that you will need to share on GitHub repositories.
