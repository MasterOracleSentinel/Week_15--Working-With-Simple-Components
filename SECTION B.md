-------------------------------------------------------

In Dr. Williams’ videos and the Refactoring The ATM activity, you encountered examples of how to refactor the ATM:

* Adding validation so users can’t withdraw more money than the account balance
* Modifying the user interface to require users to select deposit or withdraw before an input field is visible

The task in this activity is to refactor your ATM project and share it with your peers. Be sure to refer to Video 15.6 ATM Deposit And Cashback Buttons before you refactor your project.

-------------------------------------------------
If you chose to implement one of the previous examples, there are numerous ways you may have done that. You also may have refactored the ATM project in other ways. 

In the discussion board below, share the link to your ATM GitHub repository. It should have a completed README file that includes:

Title of the project
Description of the project, including the improvements you made
When you share your link, write a short post answering the following questions:

What improvements did you make?
Why did you choose this approach?
What did you find challenging about this process? How did you overcome the challenges?
Are you impressed by your peers’ improvements? Did you have similar challenges? Reply to them to continue the conversation.
